This is a package for GNU/Emacs that let you send HTML emails from
Emacs, and they will look exactly as they were sent from Microsoft
Outlook with all fancy HTML formatting that Outlook does.

It works on Linux and does not use Outlook, so you no longer need a
Windows box to be able to communicate with your co-workers who use
Outlook.

* Requirements
- GNU/Emacs 25.3 compiled with libxml2 (other versions are not tested)
- [[https://github.com/djcb/mu][mu4e]] package (can be installed from your distribution package
  manager)

* Description
The package provides functions to format a plain-text reply and insert
it into HTML email with a proper "Outlook-style" quotation (i.e. whole
email thread at the bottom).

outlook.el is meant to be used together with other email packages for
Emacs, extending their functionality. As for now, only =mu4e=
integration is supported out-of-box, but feel free to submit a PR with
integration to other packages (gnus, wanderlust, notmuch, etc.)

* Mu4e
To integrate outlook.el with mu4e package you have to ~(require
'outlook-mu4e)~ and invoke ~outlook-mu4e-message-finalize~ function
during email reply composition.

It will replace message body with HTML code that you can send by =C-c
C-c=. Note, that you can (and actually should) preview the message by
calling ~outlook-mu4e-html-message-preview~ to view it in a
web-browser.

*This package is in beta quality, so make sure you PREVIEW the message
 before actually sending it, to avoid sending garbage to your co-workers!*

* Customization
- =outlook-organization-domain-regexp= ::
     Set this variable to check that recipients email addresses belong
     to your organization domain. Otherwise you will be asked for a
     confirmation before sending a mail.

     This variable only works if =message-mode= is used for composing
     a message (this is true for =mu4e=, but may be different for
     other mail packages).

     Example:
     #+begin_src elisp
       (setq outlook-organization-domain-regexp "fsf\\.org")
     #+end_src
